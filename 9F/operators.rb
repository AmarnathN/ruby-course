Operators
- Arithmatic operators
- Assignment operators
  =
  a = 7
  +=
  a += 9 | a = a + 9 | a = 7 + 9 | a = 16
  -=
  *=
  /=
  %=
  ** | a = 4 | a**2 | 4 * 4 | 16
- Comparision operators
  a = 8
  b = 9
   > | a > b | false
   < | a < b | true
   == | a == b | false
   >= | a >= b | false
   <= | a <= b | true
   .eql?  # value , data type
   .equal?  # | object_id

- Logical operators
 a =  4
 b = 5
 a > 4 and b < 5 && b > 5

 false
  and
  &&

  or
  ||

  a == 4 or b < 4
  true

- Parallel assignment operators
  a,b,c,d = [1,2,3,4,5]
- Ternary operators
  condition ? logic1:logic2
  # if condition is true logic1 will execute otherwise logic2
- Bitwise operators
